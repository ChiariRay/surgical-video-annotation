## Billing

This section describes the billing model and gives short a
description of limitations for each plan.

For more information,
see: [Pricing Plans](https://www.cvat.ai/post/new-pricing-plans)

### Solo plan

**Account/Month**: The **Solo** plan has a fixed price and is
designed **for personal use only**. It doesn't allow collaboration with team members,
but removes all the other limits of the **Free** plan.

> **Note**: Although it allows the creation of an organization and
> access for up to 3 members -- it is _for trial purposes_ only,
> organization and members _will have all the limitations of the **Free** plan_.

### Team plan

**Member/ month**: The **Team** plan allows you to create
an organization and add team members who can collaborate on projects.
The **monthly payment for the plan depends on the number of team members you've added**.
All limits of the **Free** plan will be removed.

> **Note**: The organization owner is also part of the team.
> So, if you have three annotators working, you'll need to pay
> for 4 seats (3 annotators + 1 organization owner).

To add **VAT** or **Organization** details to the invoice, after subscribing to the Team plan,
go to **Manage Team Plan** > **Manage** > **Billing information**.

## Payment methods

If you've added a user **before the current billing period ends**,
the payment will be prorated for the remaining time until the
next billing cycle begins. From the following month onward,
the full payment will be charged.

In case you **removed the user before the current billing period ends**,
funds will not be returned to your account,
but next month you will pay less by the amount of unused funds.

## Change plan

The procedure is the same for both **Solo** and **Team** plans.

If for some reason you want to change your plan, you need to:

1. Unsubscribe from the previous plan.
2. If you need a refund, contact us at [accounting@cvat.ai](mailto:accounting@cvat.ai).
3. Subscribe to a new plan.

## Can I subscribe to several plans?

Paid plans are not mutually exclusive.
You can have several active subscriptions,
for example, the **Solo** plan and several **Team**
plans for different organizations.

## Cancel plan

This section describes how to cancel your CVAT subscription
and what will happen to your data.

### What will happen to my data?

Once you have terminated your subscription, your data will remain
accessible within the system for a month. During this period,
you will be unable to add new tasks and free plan limits will be applied.

In case you possess a substantial amount of data,
it will be switched to read-only mode. It means
you will not be able to save annotations, add any resources,
and so on.

Following the one month, you will receive a
notification requesting you to either remove the
excess data or it will be deleted automatically.

### Solo plan

1. In the top right corner click on your nickname, then **Organization** > **Personal workspace**.
2. Click again on the nickname, then follow to **Manage Solo plan** > **Manage** > **Cancel plan**
